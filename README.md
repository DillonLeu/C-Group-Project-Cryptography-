# C++ Programming Group Project
In this project, I will be programming on a type of mathematical cipher known as Hill Cipher. It converts text and key into matrices form, and using these variables to perform matrix multiplication, inverse matrix, and modulo arithmetic operation to do encryption and decryption. This method is also a symmetric key cryptography, meaning both sender and receiver can gain access to the same key for encrypting and decrypting text.
