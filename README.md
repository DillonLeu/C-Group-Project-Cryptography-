# C++ Programming Group Project
In this project, I will be working on a specific type of mathematical cipher known as Hill Cipher. It used matrices to do matrix multiplication, inverse matrix, and modulo arithmetic to do encryption and decryption. This method is also a symmetric key cryptography, meaning both sender and receiver can gain access to the same key for encrypting and decrypting text.
